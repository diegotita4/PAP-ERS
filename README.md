# Project: Sector Rotation Strategy

## Objective
Develop a strategy that helps predict economic cycles and implement a sector rotation investment strategy.

## Project Overview
This project leverages leading economic indicators to create a model that aids portfolio managers in determining when to be Overweight, Underweight, or Neutral in pro-cyclical assets. The goal is to generate an investment strategy that shifts between pro-cyclical and anti-cyclical sectors based on the economic cycle.

## Project Outline
1. **Project Definition and Scope:** 
   - Introduction to the project, including software and terminology.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of economic indicators and their percentage changes.
   - Graphical comparison and analysis of economic indicators versus the S&P 500.

2. **Model Proposal:**
   - Develop a model for the sector rotation strategy using the given economic indicators.
   - Generate a discretized output (Y) based on the performance of the S&P 500.
   - Download historical data for the benchmark and financial assets.
   - Classify assets based on their pro-cyclical or anti-cyclical nature and their beta.

3. **Model Training and Validation:**
   - Train and validate the proposed model.
   - Optimize and generalize the parameters of the proposed model.
   - Identify expected trends (Overweight, Underweight, Neutral).
   - Select the investment strategy.

4. **Strategy Implementation:**
   - Implement the sector rotation investment strategy using the algorithm developed in the previous phase.
   - Perform dynamic backtesting with random asset selection.
   - Analyze the performance metrics of the strategy.
   - Compare the strategy against a benchmark.

5. **Final Deliverables:**
   - Final corrections and adjustments.
   - Presentation of results in a paper format.
   - Final project presentation.
